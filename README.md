*rTorrent Community Wiki and GH Pages Repository*

:pen: | The [wiki](https://github.com/rtorrent-community/rtorrent-community.github.io/wiki) is editable by any GitHub user, and thus the often-expressed wish for a complete and current reference depends on *YOU*.

:book: | The [rTorrent Handbook](https://github.com/rtorrent-community/rtorrent-docs#rtorrent-docs) documentation project takes input from the wiki and puts it into a more formal, cross-referenced handbook. You are very welcome to contribute to the handbook too, it uses *Sphinx* to generate the final result at *Read the Docs*.
